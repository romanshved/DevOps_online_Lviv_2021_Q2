I installed GIT, set it up.
Then I created a private repo on GitHub and cloned it to my workstation.
After that I created an empty file named "readme.txt" and made my initial commit.
Then I created new branch called "develop" and created index.html empty file, then commited it.
Then I completed step 13 from task 1.1 and made it to step 14 where I was stuck, because I didn't know how to make image source, but I googled it and made it to step 15.
After that I created styles branch, added styles folder with styles source in it and merged branches "images" and "styles" to "develop", resovled the conflict that appeared and merged "develop" into "main"
Then I completed all the following steps until step 27, where I am now.


DevOps is a methodology, that organizes development process from beginning to end and provides fully-automated solutions for project needs using different tools.
