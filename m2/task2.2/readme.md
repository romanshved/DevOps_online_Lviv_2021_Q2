Task 2.2

I registered with AWS using AWS Free Tier, found the hands-on tutorials and repeated some of them.

Then I created and connected to a Linux VM with Amazon Lightsail: <img src="screenshots/Screenshot_23.png">

Then I launched another Linux VM with Amazon EC2, created a snapshot and attached an EBS Disk_D to the instance:

Then I launched the third instance from the snapshot of the previous instance and reattached Disk_D to my new instance:

Then I proceeded to step 13 and explored the possibilities of creating a domain name for a site with Amazon Route 53. I looked through a tutorial but didn't register my domain because it was not included in AWS Free Tier resources.

Here is the step 14 (14. Review the 10-minute example Deploy Docker Containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Repeat, create a cluster, and run the online demo 
application or better other application with custom settings.) result:

After that I created a static website on Amazon S3 using my custom domain and provided it with all necessary information, listed in Task 2.2, step 15.
