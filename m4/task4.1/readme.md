TASK4.1


Part 1

1.I created a project with 4 PC-PTs connected to Hub-PT with copper straight-through
2.<img src="screenshots/1.png">

3.I assigned every PC it's unique IP-adress.
4.I checked th efficiency of the network by sending ICMPs from one PC to another.
5,6.I started a simulation using Simaulation Panel and traced the packets in the network:

7.I looked up the information about packets' conformity to the OSI model:

8.Then I deleted the IP-adresses from every PC and as a result the network stopped working, to be exact, the packets couldn't been sent, because of no adresses.


Part 2

9.I created another project with 4 PCs connected with copper straight through to a hub and 2 more PCs and a server connected to another hub. Both hubs are also connected with copper cross-over.
10.I assigned to every node a unique IP-adress
11.I checked the network if it's efficient

Part 3

12.I created a new project with 4 PCs connected to a switch with copper straight-through and repeated steps 3-8 from Part 1:

13.


Part 4

14-17.I expanded the project, adding 4 more PCs and 1 more switch connected to the first one with copper cross-over. Also I added 1 port to each switch, assigned unique IP-adresses and checked network's efficiency.

18-22. I added a router between two switches and configured the network to work properly
